# Iranian Car Identifier using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)




## Overview
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify Iranian car models from images sourced from Bama and Divar, the largest platforms for direct purchase and sale of goods in Iran. The model is trained on a dataset of car images and achieves high accuracy in classifying the car models.
## Features

- Image Classification: Identify the make and model of Iranian cars from images.
- Data Augmentation: Enhances the dataset with transformations to improve model robustness.


## Components

1. **car_url.py**: Script to find URLs of images related to Iranian cars from the web.
2. **Cars_CNN_Model.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the CNN model implementation for classifying car models.
3. **Geometric_Transformations_.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook focused on manual geometric transformations for data augmentation.
